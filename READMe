    Started the project. I chose typescript as it is relevant to the industry right now. 
    Created the index, player and enemy files. Using webpack to create a live server to test this. 
    Added player movement to the arrow keys. Added enemy, and enemy collision. 
    If player collides with enemy, player position is now reset to beginning.
